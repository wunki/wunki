### Hi you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Petar, a software engineer focussed on building simple and resilient {software, company, life}. I'm also a dad of five who likes to run long distances slowly.

Passionate about anything that has to do with building products, and Lisp.

In my day-job, I'm leading the technology department at Workera, where we help people achieve their career goals. Feel free to contact me if you want to talk about any of these!
