### Hi you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Petar, software engineer focussed on building simple and resilient {software, company, life}. I'm also a dad of five who likes to run long distances.

Currently I'm keeping myself busy with distributed systems, system design and this hot new language called Rust. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about any of these!
