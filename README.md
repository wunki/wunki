### Hi you! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Petar, a software developer focused on building resilient and straightforward {software, company, life}. I'm also a dad of five who likes to run slowly.

Passionate about anything that has to do with building software.

During the day, I lead all things tech at Workera, where we help people achieve their career goals. Feel free to contact me if you want to talk about any of the above!
